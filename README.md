This application uses the command line interface like git bash or terminal to retrieve data from a person's GitHub profile.
The data is then placed into an html file and turned into a pdf file.

it is important to run "npm install" in git bash for the node modules. the remaining commands are "node index.js" and "node pdfCreate.js" with git bash using the same folder.
